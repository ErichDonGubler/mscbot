Nothing to see here yet. Move along.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

* `DATABASE_URL`: postgres database URL
* `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`: number of connections to maintain in the pool
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: your GitHub app's OAuth client ID
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: your GitHub app's OAuth client secret
* `GITHUB_USER_AGENT`: the UA string to send to GitHub (they request that you send your GitHub username or the app name you registered for the client ID)

## Database

I'm testing with PostgreSQL 9.5. To init, make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set, and:

```
cargo install diesel_cli
diesel migration run
```

That should then have whichever database you've specified ready to receive data.

## Bootstrapping

This doesn't *fully* work yet, but run `cargo run --release -- bootstrap SOURCE YYYY-MM-DD` to populate the database with all relevant data since YYYY-MM-DD.

Substitute `SOURCE` in that example with one of:

* `github`
* `release-channel`
